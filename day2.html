    <h5>COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN let, var AND const</h5>

    <h5>Var</h5>
    <p>Since the birth of JavaScript, var has been the most traditional method of declaring variables. Var-declared variables are function-scoped, which means their scope is constrained to the function in which they are specified. It will still be possible to access a variable that is declared using the var keyword inside of a block, such as a loop or conditional expression.</p>
    <h5>
        Scope of var
    </h5>
    <p>
Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.

var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.
    </p>

    <div class="container border w-50">
        <code>
            var greeter = "hey hi";<br>

            function newFunction() {<br>
                var hello = "hello";<br>
            }
        </code>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5>
            Let
        </h5>
        <p>
            let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.
        </p>

        <h5>
            let is block scoped
        </h5>
        <p>A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block. <br>

            So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block. Let me explain this with an example:</p>

            <div class="border container w-50">
                <code>
                    let greeting = "say Hi"; <br>
                    let times = 4; <br>
                 
                    if (times > 3) { <br>
                         let hello = "say Hello instead"; <br>
                         console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"<br>
                     } <br>
                    console.log(hello) // hello is not defined
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                We see that using hello outside its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. This is because let variables are block scoped.
            </p>
    </div>

    <div>

        <h5>
            Const
        </h5>
        <p>
            Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
            
            const declarations are block scoped
            Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
            
            const cannot be updated or re-declared
            This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const, we can neither do this:
        </p>

        <div class="container border w-50">
            <code>
                const greeting = "say Hi";<br>
                greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable. <br>
            </code>
        </div>
        <p>
            nor this:
        </p>
        <div class="container border w-50">
            <code>           
                const greeting = "say Hi"; <br>
                const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared <br>
            </code>
        </div>
    </div>


Every const declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of declaration.
